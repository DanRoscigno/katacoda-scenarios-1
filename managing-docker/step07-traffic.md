### Generate some traffic through NGINX
At the top of the terminal you will see an NGINX tab.  Click on that and you will see the default NGINX page.  Add a page name to the URL, for example /foo, and this will generate a 404 error.  Now return to the Katacoda tab and click on the Kibana tab above the terminal.  Open the Dashboards and search for nginx, click on the Filebeat NGINX overview.
